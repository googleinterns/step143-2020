# Rideshare App

Whether a college student is going back home for the holidays, or going back to school after a long break, they will always need transportation one way or another.  College students tend to be shorter on funds than the average adult, so carpooling is a great way to get somewhere cheap.  However, a problem that exists with current ridesharing is that it is that the process is very casual, as (at least in California) usually college students use Facebook groups in order to organize their rides.  This can be very uncertain, as sometimes students flake, sometimes students arenâ€™t very organized, and sometimes students are unsure whether they will get scammed or not for their money.  The driver and the passenger need a better way to organize these rideshares.

Thus, our objective for this project is to create a webapp to streamline the process of finding a carpool / ridesharing.  This will make rides more organized, comfortable, safe, and less awkward.  This will also eliminate any worries the driver or passengers may have of random strangers scamming them.
